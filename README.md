**User guide:**

Welcome to the user guide for the crossword mobile game. In this guide, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to play the game.

When you launch the game, you will see a home screen with a "Play" button. Click on the "Play" button to begin playing the game.

You will be prompted to choose a difficulty level. There are three levels of difficulty to choose from: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Since this is our first play, all the highscore is set to 0. Select the level you want to play by clicking on it.

After you have selected the difficulty level, the game screen will appear. The game screen consists of a grid of blank spaces for the crossword and a list of characters to input. Easy level has 60s, medium level has 80s and hard level has 120s.

If you get stuck, you can use hints to help you solve the crossword. Click on the magnifying lens icon on top right to get a hint and the game will randomly populate 1 letter. The maximum of hints you can get from each level is 2 (easy), 3 (medium) and 4 (hard). However, each time using hints will reduce 100 points from your score. Once you ran out of hint, you cannot use this feature in this game.

Total score is calculated = Current score + (current remaining time x 20) + (word's length x 10). If your score is higher than that level highscore, it will replace the old score to become new highscore.

You can replay as many time as you want or choose exit to exit the game. Your score would still be stored in the local device so next time you play you can try to beat your old highscore.
